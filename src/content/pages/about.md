# The Modern Architect

> **Current Role:** Associate Director (Infrastructure & Cloud Architecture) at Kyndryl India.
> **Intent:** I am looking for Principal Architect or Head of Infrastructure roles where I can leverage 20 years of "Iron-to-Cloud" experience.

> "Complexity is the enemy of execution."

I am **Virtual Sachin**, an Associate Director and Cloud Architect with over **20 years** of experience building the internet's backbone. From pulling fiber cables in dusty data centers to architecting serverless ecosystems for global financial giants, I have seen every layer of the stack.

I don't just design systems; I build **digital cathedrals**—structures that are robust, beautiful in their utility, and built to outlast the trends.

## My Philosophy

* **Infrastructure as Code, Culture as Code:** A script can build a server, but only culture can maintain it. I automate the "boring stuff" so teams can focus on innovation.
* **Identity is the Perimeter:** The firewall is dead. In a work-from-anywhere world, I secure the Identity and the Data, not just the network edge.
* **Data Gravity:** Architecture follows data. Understanding how information flows is the key to designing the pipes that carry it.

## What I Bring to a Team

* **Bridge Builder:** I speak both "Legacy Data Center" and "Cloud Native", bridging the gap for enterprises in transition.
* **Cost Discipline:** I treat infrastructure cost as an architectural metric, not an afterthought.
* **Mentorship:** I don't just build systems; I build the teams that run them.
