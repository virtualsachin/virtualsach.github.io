# Let's Build Something Resilient

I am always interested in connecting with engineering leaders and recruiters to discuss complex challenges in Cloud Architecture, Infrastructure Modernization, and Team Leadership.

While I am currently driving value as an Associate Director, I am open to discussing Principal Architect or Head of Infrastructure roles where I can leverage my 20 years of experience to transform technical debt into business velocity.

## How I Can Help Your Team

* **Strategic Vision:** Bridging the gap between legacy data centers and cloud-native ecosystems.
* **Operational Rigor:** Implementing "Chaos Engineering" and "Infrastructure as Code" at an enterprise scale.
* **Mentorship:** Building high-performing engineering cultures that prioritize resilience.
