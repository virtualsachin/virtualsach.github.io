# Executive Summary

**Artemis Hospital** needed a digital backbone that could support open access for hundreds of daily visitors while maintaining an ironclad shield around Patient Health Records.

I implemented a rigid **Zone-Based Security Architecture** on Cisco ASA firewalls that ensured **100% uptime** and **Zero Data Breaches**.

# The Challenge

A hospital network is a chaotic mix of trust levels.

* **The Conflict:** Doctors need instant access to records on tablets (Mobility), while patients expect high-speed Guest Wi-Fi.
* **The Risk:** Lateral movement from the Guest Network to the **Hospital Information System (HIS)** or **Biomedical** equipment.
* **Compliance:** Strict healthcare regulations demanded absolute proof of data isolation.

# The Solution

We moved beyond simple Access Control Lists (ACLs) to a strict **Zone-Based Policy**.

## Tech Stack

* **Firewall:** **Cisco ASA 5500 Series** (The Core Enforcer).
* **Switching:** **Cisco Catalyst 6500** Core Switches.
* **Policy Logic:** Cisco ASA **Security Levels** (0 to 100).
* **Concepts:** **DMZ**, **Physical Segmentation**, **IPSec VPN**.

## Technical Deep Dive

### 1. The Security Level Concept

The Cisco ASA uses "Security Levels" to define innate trust. Traffic flows from High to Low by default, but *never* from Low to High without explicit permission.

* **Inside Zone (Level 100):** The HIS Database and Critical Servers. Trusted above all else.
* **Biomedical Zone (Level 90):** MRI Machines, CT Scanners. High trust, but isolated.
* **DMZ (Level 50):** Public Website, Patient Portal.
* **Outside/Guest (Level 0):** The Internet and Guest Wi-Fi. Untrusted.

### 2. Physical & Logical Isolation

We physically isolated the **Biomedical network**. These machines often run legacy, unpatchable operating systems (like Windows XP embedded).

**The Policy:**

* No traffic *in* from the internet.
* One-way outbound **IPSec tunnels** for Teleradiology (sending X-Rays to remote specialists).

# The Outcome

* **Security:** Achieved **Zero Data Breaches** or viral outbreaks during my tenure, despite frequent malware nodes on the guest network.
* **Availability:** Maintained **100% Uptime** for the critical HIS and Voice (EPABX) networks.
* **Safety:** Successfully isolated the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT) long before the term existed.
