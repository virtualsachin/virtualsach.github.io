            This is an extended resume. While a standard CV gives you bullet
            points, this site gives you the context, the architecture diagrams,
            and the <span class="italic text-white">"war stories"</span> behind the
            projects. It is designed for Hiring Managers who want to understand <span
                class="font-bold text-white">how I think</span
            >, not just what I did.
