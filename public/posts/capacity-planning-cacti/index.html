            Capacity Planning with Cacti: Predicting the Bandwidth Cliff

        <p>In the modern era of public cloud, &ldquo;capacity planning&rdquo; often just means setting an auto-scaling policy and forgetting about it. If traffic spikes, the cloud provider simply spins up more instances.</p>
<p>But back at Net4, we lived in a different reality. We didn&rsquo;t have elastic compute or burstable bandwidth on demand. We had physical circuits with hard ceilings. A 1 Gbps link was exactly 1 Gbps. If traffic hit 1.1 Gbps, the network didn&rsquo;t scale; it broke. Packets dropped, latency skyrocketed, and customers went offline.</p>
<p>In that environment, capacity planning wasn&rsquo;t an administrative task; it was a survival mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool-cacti-and-the-snmp-heartbeat">The Tool: Cacti and the SNMP Heartbeat</h2>
<p>We relied on <strong>Cacti</strong>, a frontend for RRDTool (Round Robin Database Tool). It was the industry standard for a reason.</p>
<p>Every five minutes, Cacti would reach out to our border routers via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) and ask a simple question: <em>&ldquo;How many octets have passed through interface GigabitEthernet0/1?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It would plot these data points on a graph. To the untrained eye, these graphs just look like jagged mountains. To a network architect, they are a narrative of human behavior. You can see when the city wakes up, when the lunch rush hits, and when the backup jobs kick off at night.</p>
<h2 id="the-analysis-beyond-the-average">The Analysis: Beyond the Average</h2>
<p>The mistake most junior engineers make is looking at the &ldquo;Average&rdquo; utilization.</p>
<p>Averages are comfortable liars. If a link is idle for 12 hours and 100% saturated for 12 hours, the average is 50%. The dashboard says &ldquo;Green,&rdquo; but your customers are screaming for half the day.</p>
<p>My strategy focused on the <strong>95th Percentile</strong>.</p>
<p>This metric discards the top 5% of data points (bursts) to ignore anomalies, giving you the &ldquo;sustained peak&rdquo; utilization—the bandwidth you are actually paying for and using.</p>
<p>But I went deeper. I wasn&rsquo;t just checking if we were red today. I was calculating the <em>slope</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-bandwidth-cliff">The Bandwidth Cliff</h2>
<p>One spring, I was auditing our primary transit link usage over a 3-month period.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, things looked fine. We were peaking at about 70% utilization. Plenty of headroom, right? Most teams would have closed the ticket and moved on.</p>
<p>But when I zoomed out to the quarterly view, I saw the trend line. Our traffic wasn&rsquo;t flat; it was growing at a consistent rate of 5% week-over-week.</p>
<p>It was a slow creep, invisible in the daily noise. But simple math revealed the danger. Compounding that 5% growth meant that our &ldquo;safe&rdquo; 70% utilization would hit 100% saturation in exactly six weeks.</p>
<p>I looked at the calendar. My projection showed we would hit the &ldquo;<strong>Bandwidth Cliff</strong>&quot;—total saturation—by July 1st.</p>
<h2 id="the-silent-win">The Silent Win</h2>
<p>I took the data to management. I showed them the graph, the slope, and the math.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not out of bandwidth today,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;But we will be out of bandwidth on July 1st. And provisioning a new carrier circuit takes 4 weeks. We need to sign the PO today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We upgraded the circuit two weeks before the predicted deadline.</p>
<p>On July 1st, traffic surged exactly as predicted. It crossed the old 1 Gbps limit without a stutter, flowing smoothly into the new capacity. No packets dropped. No alarms triggered. No customers called.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>
<p>In Operations, silence is the only true applause.</p>
<p>If you are fighting fires, you are already losing. The upgrade was a non-event, and that is exactly the point.</p>
<p>The lesson I carried forward is this: <strong>&ldquo;Real capacity planning isn&rsquo;t looking at a dashboard to see where you are today. It&rsquo;s looking at the dashboard to see where you will be next month.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The difference between a stable network and a catastrophic outage is often just a spreadsheet and the foresight to trust the trend line.</p>
