All Markdown content must adhere to these "Modern Technocrat" formatting rules:

The "2-3-1" Rule (Readability):

Paragraphs must never exceed 3 lines.

Use 2 sentences average per paragraph.

1 idea per paragraph.

Visual Anchors (Scanning):

Bold ( ): Use strictly for Concepts (e.g., Eventual Consistency), not for emphasis.

Italics ( ): Use for internal monologue or "air quotes."

Lists: Any sequence of 3+ items MUST be a bullet list.

Code Blocks: MUST always specify language (e.g., ```bash) and include a comment # explaining the snippet.

Structural Components:

The Hook: Start every post with a > Blockquote summary or a provocative statement.

The Divider: Use --- to visually separate the "Problem" from the "Solution."

The Verdict: End every post with a ### Key Takeaway section.

No "Wall of Text": Break up sections every 150 words with a Header (H2) or a visual element (Code/List).
